```markdown
# Unit Test Execution

## Run Unit Tests

### 1. Execute All Unit Tests
\`\`\`bash
[Command to run all unit tests]

\`\`\`

### 2. Review Test Results
- **Expected**: [X] tests pass, 0 failures
- **Test Coverage**: [Expected coverage percentage]
- **Test Report Location**: [Path to test reports]

### 3. Fix Failing Tests
If tests fail:
1. Review test output in [location]
2. Identify failing test cases
3. Fix code issues
4. Rerun tests until all pass
```

---

## Step 4: Generate Integration Test Instructions

Create `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/integration-test-instructions.md`:

```markdown
# Integration Test Instructions

## Purpose
Test interactions between units/services to ensure they work together correctly.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: [Unit A] → [Unit B] Integration
- **Description**: [What is being tested]
- **Setup**: [Required test environment setup]
- **Test Steps**: [Step-by-step test execution]
- **Expected Results**: [What should happen]
- **Cleanup**: [How to clean up after test]

### Scenario 2: [Unit B] → [Unit C] Integration
[Similar structure]

## Setup Integration Test Environment

### 1. Start Required Services
\`\`\`bash
[Commands to start services]
# Example: docker-compose up, start test database
\`\`\`

### 2. Configure Service Endpoints
\`\`\`bash
[Commands to configure endpoints]

\`\`\`
```

---

## Step 5: Generate Performance Test Instructions (If Applicable)

Create `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/performance-test-instructions.md`:

```markdown
# Performance Test Instructions

## Purpose
Validate system performance under load to ensure it meets requirements.

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: < [X]ms for [Y]% of requests
- **Throughput**: [X] requests/second
- **Concurrent Users**: Support [X] concurrent users
- **Error Rate**: < [X]%

## Setup Performance Test Environment

### 1. Prepare Test Environment
\`\`\`bash
[Commands to set up performance testing]
# Example: scale services, configure load balancers
\`\`\`

### 2. Configure Test Parameters
- **Test Duration**: [X] minutes
- **Ramp-up Time**: [X] seconds
- **Virtual Users**: [X] users

## Run Performance Tests

### 1. Execute Load Tests
\`\`\`bash
[Command to run load tests]
# Example: jmeter -n -t test.jmx, k6 run script.js
\`\`\`

### 2. Execute Stress Tests
\`\`\`bash
[Command to run stress tests]
# Example: gradually increase load until failure
\`\`\`

### 3. Analyze Performance Results
- **Response Time**: [Actual vs Expected]
- **Throughput**: [Actual vs Expected]
- **Error Rate**: [Actual vs Expected]
- **Bottlenecks**: [Identified bottlenecks]
- **Results Location**: [Path to performance reports]

## Performance Optimization

If performance doesn't meet requirements:
1. Identify bottlenecks from test results
2. Optimize code/queries/configurations
3. Rerun tests to validate improvements
```

---

## Step 6: Generate Additional Test Instructions (As Needed)

Based on project requirements, generate additional test instruction files:

### Contract Tests (For Microservices)
Create `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/contract-test-instructions.md`:
- API contract validation between services
- Consumer-driven contract testing
- Schema validation

### Security Tests
Create `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/security-test-instructions.md`:
- Vulnerability scanning
- Dependency security checks
- Authentication/authorization testing
- Input validation testing

### End-to-End Tests
Create `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/e2e-test-instructions.md`:
- Complete user workflow testing
- Cross-service scenarios
- UI testing (if applicable)

---

## Step 7: Generate Test Summary

Create `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/build-and-test-summary.md`:

```markdown
# Build and Test Summary

## Build Status
- **Build Tool**: [Tool name]
- **Build Status**: [Success/Failed]
- **Build Artifacts**: [List artifacts]
- **Build Time**: [Duration]

## Test Execution Summary

### Unit Tests
- **Total Tests**: [X]
- **Passed**: [X]
- **Failed**: [X]
- **Coverage**: [X]%
- **Status**: [Pass/Fail]

### Integration Tests
- **Test Scenarios**: [X]
- **Passed**: [X]
- **Failed**: [X]
- **Status**: [Pass/Fail]

### Performance Tests
- **Response Time**: [Actual] (Target: [Expected])
- **Throughput**: [Actual] (Target: [Expected])
- **Error Rate**: [Actual] (Target: [Expected])
- **Status**: [Pass/Fail]

### Additional Tests
- **Contract Tests**: [Pass/Fail/N/A]
- **Security Tests**: [Pass/Fail/N/A]
- **E2E Tests**: [Pass/Fail/N/A]

## Overall Status
- **Build**: [Success/Failed]
- **All Tests**: [Pass/Fail]
- **Ready for Operations**: [Yes/No]

## Next Steps
[If all pass]: Build and test verified; the engine's `next` directive decides what follows (Operations applies only in scopes/plans that include it)
[If failures]: Address failing tests and rebuild
```

---

## Step 8: Update State Tracking

Stage progress is engine-owned. After the user approves at the gate (Step 9), run `python <skill>/scripts/engine.py report --stage build-and-test --result approved` (fall back to `python3` if `python` is unavailable). Never hand-edit the Stage Progress / Current Status sections of `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` — they are engine-owned.

---

## Step 9: Present Results to User

Present completion message in this structure:
     1. **Completion Announcement** (mandatory): Always start with this:

```markdown
# 🔨 Build and Test Complete
```

     2. **AI Summary** (optional): Provide structured bullet-point summary of build and test results
        - Format: "Build and test has completed with the following results:"
        - List build status and artifacts
        - List test results by category (unit, integration, performance, etc.)
        - List generated instruction files
        - DO NOT include workflow instructions ("please review", "let me know", "proceed to next phase", "before we proceed")
        - Keep factual and content-focused
     3. **Formatted Workflow Message** (mandatory): Always end with this exact format:

```markdown
> **📋 <u>**REVIEW REQUIRED:**</u>**  
> Please examine the build and test summary at: `aidlc-docs/construction/build-and-test/build-and-test-summary.md`



> **🚀 <u>**WHAT'S NEXT?**</u>**
>
> **You may:**
>
> 🔧 **Request Changes** - Ask for modifications to the build and test instructions based on your review
> ✅ **Approve & Continue** - Approve build and test results and continue (the engine routes what follows)

---
```

### Commit Protocol

Timing is fixed: the completion message at this gate presents the commit plan in its body → the user's "Approve & Continue" counts as both stage approval and authorization to execute the commit plan → only then run `python <skill>/scripts/engine.py report --stage build-and-test --result approved` (per Step 8) → execute the commit plan. The plan is never presented after the approval click, and no git write happens before `report approved`.

- Presenting the commit plan in the message body is compatible with APG-05 ("No Template Modification"): the two-option template stays untouched — the plan is plain prose in the message body, not a third visible option.
- **Request Changes path, or the user preferring to handle commits manually** → execute NO git write operations.

Protocol:

1. **Dirty-file triage**: classify every dirty workspace path by whether this session's tool calls actually wrote it. First class: artifacts produced by this workflow. Every other dirty file is second class — list it, NEVER stage it silently.
2. **One-shot commit plan presentation**: list first-class files grouped by their owning stage and unit; list second-class files as a plain inventory (never staged automatically).
3. **No amend, no push** — unless the user explicitly asks.
4. **Non-git workspace**: align with the AUD-02 precedent — no git → mark commit information `unknown`, do not block the flow, and skip this entire protocol.
5. **Audit**: write the commit plan and its confirmation outcome to `audit.md`; record the resulting commit hashes in `build-and-test-summary.md`.
6. **Commit order**: commit work results first; IF any archival/handoff pending items exist at that point, commit them afterward (conditional — at build-and-test time these typically do not exist).

**Autonomous Mode (AM-03)**: never commit automatically under Autonomous Mode — the completion message lists the pending-to-commit inventory and the user decides (see `../extensions/workflow/autonomous-mode/autonomous-mode.md`).

---

## Step 10: Log Interaction

**MANDATORY**: Log the stage completion in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`:

```markdown
## Build and Test Stage
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**Build Status**: [Success/Failed]
**Test Status**: [Pass/Fail]
**Files Generated**:
- build-instructions.md
- unit-test-instructions.md
- integration-test-instructions.md
- performance-test-instructions.md
- build-and-test-summary.md
